\begin{theorem}\label{thm:hcp2cp-typing}
  If $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$ in \hcp, then $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$ in \cp.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of the derivation of $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$.
  From $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$ we conclude that $\tm{P}$ is \textsc{Mix}-free, and
  therefore all sequents in the derivation of $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$ have a single
  environment.
\end{proof}
