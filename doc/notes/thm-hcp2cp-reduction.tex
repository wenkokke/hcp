\begin{theorem}\label{thm:hcp2cp-reduction}
  If $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$ and $\reducesto{P}{Q}$ in \hcp, then $\reducesto{P}{Q}$ in \cp.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of the derivation of $\reducesto{P}{Q}$.
  From $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$ we conclude that $\tm{P}$ is \textsc{Mix}-free, and
  therefore \hcpRedGammaMix will never occur in the derivation of $\reducesto{P}{Q}$.
\end{proof}
