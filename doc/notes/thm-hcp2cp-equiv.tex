\begin{theorem}\label{thm:hcp2cp-equiv}
  If $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$ and $\tm{P}\equiv\tm{Q}$ in \hcp, then $\tm{P}\equiv\tm{Q}$ in \cp.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of the derivation of $\tm{P}\equiv\tm{Q}$.
  From $\seq[P]{\Gamma}$ we conclude that $\tm{P}$ is \textsc{Mix}-free, and
  therefore none of the equivalences introduced in \hcp will occur in the
  derivation of $\tm{P}\equiv\tm{Q}$.
\end{proof}
